# Covid19detection
The objective of this project is to detect chest X-ray images and predict whether a person is covid-19 positive or negative. Based on X-ray images dataset, I have developed a model using convolutional neural networks.
In this pandemic times, to confirm whether a person is covid-19 infected or not, X-ray of the chest makes it very easy. So, this model which is trained and developed using X-ray images, CNN, Dense layers makes the model perfect in predicting the labels.
